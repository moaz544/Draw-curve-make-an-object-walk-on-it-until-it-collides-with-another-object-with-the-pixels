# object-walking-path-of-a-linear-equation-drawing-with-pixels
I am in college of computer science, in a computer graphics course
We asked Professor Tusk to draw a curve in pixels and he wants to draw any object that he walks on until he hits another object and he wants if it collides with another object it exits 1 and if it does not collide it exits 0
We give the parameters of the linear equation in the program and location of the second object
